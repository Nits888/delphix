Certainly! Here's a list of features for the new version of your Secrets Manager app that we've discussed and implemented:

1. **Flask Application Structure**:
   - Your application is structured using the Flask framework.
   - Routes are organized into separate files within the `routes` folder.
   - Namespaces for each route are programmatically generated.

2. **Keycloak Authentication**:
   - Implemented Keycloak authentication for securing your API endpoints.
   - Created an `auth.py` file to handle authentication logic.
   - Used the `flask_oidc` extension to integrate Keycloak with your Flask app.
   - Added the `requires_auth` decorator to protect routes that require authentication.

3. **Bucket and Secret Management**:
   - Implemented CRUD operations for managing buckets and secrets.
   - Created APIs to create, list, update, and delete buckets.
   - Created APIs to create, list, update, retrieve, and delete secrets within buckets.
   - Allowed secrets to be generated randomly.

4. **Data Encryption and Decryption**:
   - Implemented encryption and decryption of secret data.
   - Used symmetric encryption for storing secrets securely.

5. **Password Generation**:
   - Implemented an API for generating random passwords of a specified length.

6. **Swagger Documentation**:
   - Integrated Swagger UI for API documentation.
   - The documentation is accessible through the `/swagger/` route.

7. **Custom JSON Encoder**:
   - Implemented a custom JSON encoder to handle bytes conversion to base64.

8. **Synchronization Loop**:
   - Implemented a synchronization loop to retrieve bucket and secret data from the database periodically.
   - The synchronization loop runs in a separate thread.

9. **Dynamic Client ID and Secret for Buckets**:
   - When creating a bucket, a client ID is generated and saved to the database.
   - The client secret is not generated during bucket creation. Instead, it's obtained using OIDC token authentication.

10. **OIDC Token Authentication for Bucket Actions**:
    - Implemented an `authorize` endpoint to provide OIDC tokens for bucket and client ID combinations.
    - The tokens have an expiration period.
    - Token authentication is required for adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving secrets.

11. **Home Page and Buckets Listing**:
    - Created a home page to list all buckets and their associated secrets.

12. **Password Encryption**:
    - Implemented password encryption for securely storing passwords.

13. **HTML Templates**:
    - Created HTML templates for rendering the home page.

14. **Logging**:
    - Added logging throughout the application for tracking events and errors.

15. **Separate Initialization Logic**:
    - Initialized the application using the `cry_initialize` module.

16. **Threaded Synchronization**:
    - Used separate threads to run the synchronization loop.

17. **Environmental Configuration**:
    - Used environmental variables for configuration settings.

18. **Static File Serving**:
    - Served static files for documentation.

19. **Documentation Route**:
    - Created a route to render the documentation generated by Sphinx.

20. **Custom Ordering of Endpoints**:
    - Implemented a custom ordering function for the API endpoints.

These features collectively provide a comprehensive secret management solution with secure authentication, data encryption, synchronization, and API documentation.
